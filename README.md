# gutenberg-blocks
Custom Gutenberg blocks using the [`10up Gutenberg Training Theme`](https://github.com/10up/gutenberg-lessons).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This code was created using Node.js version 16.20.2 and NPM version 8.19.4

## Getting Started

Adding the supplied files to the corresponding places within the theme adds 2 custom Gutenberg blocks. They are two variations of an Article Block with title, content and image. 

Article Box Left has the article title and content on the left side with an image on the right.

Article Box Right has the article title and content on the right side with an image on the left.

This command is the important one that builds the project once it's added to the 10up theme:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will run the code to live reload etc:

```bash
npm run build
```
